This can come in handy when mixing complex projects for instance. AudioGridder comes with a plugin in AU/VST3 format and a server that supports VST2/VST3 and AudioUnit plugins to be hosted across the network. Simply run the server component on a remote machine and connect your DAW using the AudioGridder AU/VST3 plugin. This allows you to add remote insert chains or instruments into your DAW's signal paths. The DSP code of the loaded remote plugins will be executed on the remote machine and the remote plugin UI's will be streamed over the wire.

Bass DI tracks can sound mushy, and kick tracks can lose their \"pop.\" Sometimes everything below 100Hz can become such an undifferentiated soup of noise that you just don't know where to start. Start here: The bx_subfilter is just the ticket for adding clarity and definition to tracks that have troublesome low frequencies. There are lots of expensive and complicated EQ plugins out there, but when it comes to shaping your low end, the bx_subfilter is unique for its ease and simplicity. With just a few quick adjustments to its four-knob interface, you can breathe new life into those 808s that have been muddying your mix.",

Pitch shifting is achieved with a dual head crossfading delay (ala Eltro Tempophon/Dennis Gabor/Pierre Schaeffer phonogene) and is decidedly low-? The saturating feedback also allows them to be great drone and noise generators.",

    "author": "Devil Soundz",
    "description": "Devil Bass Module is definitely what you want for creating the best bass tracks for your beats. Whether you want super low to Screaming high basses Devil Bass Module has you covered. Devil Bass Module has a lot of features including 3 oscillators. The first oscillator is for the low basses the second oscillator is for mid basses and the third oscillator is for high basses. Each oscillator has an on off switch so you can mix and match which oscillators are running depending on what kind of bass you want. The first oscillator has 22 waveforms including sine, triangle, saw, square and the other 18 are mixes of sine, triangle, saw and square for low basses. The second oscillator also has 22 waveforms which are sine doubled, triangle doubled, saw doubled and square doubled and 18 mixed waveforms of sine, triangle, saw and square but all of them are doubled to raise the frequency of oscillator 2 for mid basses. The third oscillator has 22 waveforms as well which are sine tripled, triangle tripled, saw tripled and square tripled and 18 mixed waveforms of sine, triangle, saw and square but are tippled to raise the frequency of oscillator 3 making it for high basses. Devil Bass Module also has a lot more to offer with features like 8 different lowpass filters which include LP 1, LP 2, 2 different 2 pole low pass filters, 2 different 6 pole low pass filters and 2 different 10 pole low pass filters. You can also set the filters base frequency. Which also plays a part in the cutoff frequency. Devil Bass Module also has a filter cutoff knob for changing the frequency. Which adjusting the frequency knob also plays a part for adjusting the tone also along with the base frequency too. The audio saturator removes unwanted artifacts like aliasing and distortions which can be set at Off, 2X, 4X, 6X and 8X. The higher you set it to the less aliasing and distortions you will have but it also raises the tone the higher you set the saturation. The vibes selector sets what kind of vibrations the bass will have. The lower the selection the further apart the vibrations will be and the higher the selection the closer the vibrations will be. But the higher you set the vibrations the higher the tone gets because the closer the vibrations are the faster the bass is traveling. The kick feature is there to add more of a kick at the beginning of the bass to add that extra kick to your bass. You can also add saturation to the bass with the saturation feature. Which with saturation smooths out the vibrations. The velocity feature adds more vibrations at a faster pace which happens whether you are making a low, mid, or high bass. Use the phat feature to smooth the vibrations of the bass if you want them to feel more vibrant. Devil Bass Module has a drawable adsr for the volume. Devil Bass Module also has a modulation matrix with 14 slots. The sources include (Sequencer Bi-Poler, Sequencer Positive, Synced LFO 1, Synced LFO 2, drawable modulation adsr 1 and drawable modulation adsr 2). The outputs include (oscillator 1 volume, oscillator 2 volume, oscillator 3 volume, oscillator 1 phase, oscillator 2 phase, oscillator 3 phase, tone, filter). The two LFO's are synced LFO's which also have depth knobs for mixing the Synced LFO's into the bass. The sequencer is a 16 step sequencer. The sequencer is made to re-trigger on every new note. The sequencer also has 8 templates pre-made. You can save new sequencer templates by selecting a template number making a sequence and then hit the save selector and the sequence will be saved in whatever number slot you would like and there are 8 savable slots. The drawable modulation adsr's also have a mix slider for mixing whatever target the drawable modulation adsr's are set to control. Devil bass module also has a 2 band EQ with pressure for setting the lows and mids. The lows and mids each have a selector for setting the frequency range of the lows and the mids and knobs to turn up the volume for the lows and mids. The pressure knob is for adding thickness or more thud power to the bass making the bass really pound. The pressure knob also has a selector for choosing the base pressure, You can have the base pressure set to 1X or 2X depending on how much pressure you want on the bass. Devil Bass Module has a tone knob for adjusting the tone of the bass. All three oscillators use the same tone knob to keep them synced. Devil Bass Module also has a master volume knob for adjusting the overall volume level. And just so you know where your volume level is at Devil Bass Module has a peak meter. So needless to say Devil Bass Module has so many features that can make all sorts of basses.",

    "description": "Devil is a two oscillator analog subtractive wave table synthesizer capable of producing a broad variety of instruments from throbbing rhythmic basses to really intriguing rhythmic leads. Devil has lots of features. Like 100 waveforms per oscillator for a wide variety of base tones right from the start. Then on the same dialog Devil also has a widener feature for widening the overall tone. Devil also has a spread feature for making the base tone sound more full and rich. Then you can click the properties switch to go into the properties tab of each oscillator. There you will find a curve switch for making waveform more curved which adds a little bit more depth to the tone. Then right next to it you will find an append switch for doubling the waveform to make the waveform a higher frequency. Also in Devil's properties tab there is a 2 band EQ where you can adjust how much lows and highs you want in your instrument. After that you will find a smooth highs feature to take out what highs you want out of the instrument leaving behind the tone you actually want. Also Devil has a saturation feature for adding a more sine like tone to your instrument which helps the lows and highs sound more smooth. The velocity feature in devil adds momentum to your instrument. From there we move on to the envelope tabs which you will find a drawable adsr for the volume and 2 drawable modulation envelopes to use with the modulation matrix. After that we get to Devil's filter which there is one per oscillator with a total of 9 different filters. The filters include LP 1, LP 2, LP 3, LP 4, HP 1, HP 2, HP 3 and 2 BP filters that can be adjusted by the cutoff knob which changes the overall tone and frequency of your instrument. Now from there you will find the next set of tabs that each of the two oscillators have. The first tab is the 16 step sequencer which you can use as a source in the modulation matrix if you need rhythm. The sequencer is set to reset and hit on every note. There is also a template selector for using pre-defined sequence patterns. You can also save your own sequence patterns to. To use this feature select a template number make the sequence you want and click save selector and select what number you want it saved to. Now every time you want to use that sequence again you just select that template number. There are 8 template slots that you can save sequences into till you decide on the final sequence that you want to use. The next tab is the LFO tab which there are two Synced LFO's for each oscillator which can be used as a source with the modulation matrix. Each Synced LFO also has a depth knob for mixing the Synced LFO into whatever target you use. The next tab is the modulation matrix which has 6 sources and 6 targets (sources include: Sequencer Bi-poler, Sequencer Positive, Synced LFO 1, Synced LFO 2, Modulation Envelope 1 and Modulation Envelope 2) (targets include: oscillator volume, oscillator phase, oscillator pitch, filter frequency, filter resonance and distortion). The next tab is Devil's basic wave shaper for having a little bit more control over the waveforms. You can use it to shape the waveform into a few different waveforms. Devil also has built in effects like distortion, stereo width, reverb and chorus, Devil has one master volume knob for adjusting the overall volume of the instrument. Devil also has a pitch knob for changing the overall tone of the instrument. The pitch controls both oscillators to keep them in sync. Devil also has a mix knob for mixing oscillators both oscillators moving the mix knob will either have oscillator 1 or oscillator 2 the more dominant instrument. Devil is great synthesizer and plus it's free. So go ahead and try it out. Devil Soundz hopes you will enjoy.",

    "description": "Devil Reverb is a great sounding reverb for adding that extra melody and warmth to your instrument. Devil Reverb is relatively straight forward and simple to use. Use the reverb knob for adding reverb, Use the width knob for adding stereo width to your reverb making the reverb sound more full and harmonic. Use the low frequency knob for adjusting the low end frequency of the reverb. Use the high frequency knob for adjusting the high end frequency of the reverb. Adjusting the low and high frequencies sets the reverb frequency range. Use the base frequency knob for adjusting the base frequency of the reverb. The frequency range and the base frequency work together. The frequency range sets the range of the reverb and the base frequency sets the starting frequency of the reverb within the frequency range. The frequency q knob for adjusting the frequency q of the reverb. Which adds a little high frequency to the reverb for getting the extra harmonics. The reverb frequency selector is for setting what frequency the reverb starts at. Which works together with the frequency range and base frequency. So the reverb frequency is the starting frequency. The frequency range sets the range with the reverb frequency in the middle of the range. And the base frequency adjusts the reverb frequency up or down a bit. So basically it's all to fine tune the reverb frequency. Devil Reverb will definitely sound great on whatever instrument you put it on.",

Plugin presets are those used for SONGS and are so named; they may appear strange to you. These were used in conjunction with amp sims which produce harmonics and have their own tonestacks, so the total overall sculpting is more complicated than a mere EQ; therefore, the presets are not what you may expect. V0020 includes internal improvements. VST2/VST3 once again.",

    "description": "Acon Digital Multiply is a free and versatile chorus effect with a unique twist. Each simulated voice is processed with a phase randomizing filter so that unpleasant comb filter effects are avoided. The effect can be used to simulate the effect of several performers playing the same tones simultaneously, to widen the spatial image or to create special effects for sound design. Multiply can simulate up to 6 additional voices and both the pitch and the loudness of the voices can be modulated. There is also an integrated equalizer consisting of low cut, low shelf, high shelf and high cut filters that can be applied to the effect signal. An integrated pre-delay section makes it possible to create modulated and diffuse echo effects.",

    "description": "Introducing POP, the all new dynamics Plug-in from Cut Through Recordings. POP is designed with one goal in mind: give your tracks the pop that they have been missing. POP Sound Shaper is a compressor/clipper combo. It is also great for getting more control over the dynamic range of your track without losing its transients. The compressor is designed to bring out the transients of the signal. It does this by having attack and release times set to let the transients pass and then immediately clamp down on the signal. These times are locked in to make using POP as simple as possible. Set the Amount of compression and set the threshold and you're done. The compressor is followed by a soft clipper just incase you want to trim some of the higher peaks. POP also features two tone controls \"Thump\" and \"Air\" which are also dialed in to help make your tracks pop.",

Normally, direct computations in these spaces are expensive but some clever maths reduced the asymptotic costs to the point of practical use (e.g. a Reverb plugin). Parameterizing these spaces and then combining them with some fast time-varying frequency decay resulted in some interesting sounding impulse responses (IRs).",

Syntronik includes 17 amazing instruments, available as a collection or separately, with over 2,000 preset sounds covering a wide selection from 38 of the most iconic to ultra-rare and painstakingly multi-sampled vintage synthesizers. Syntronik's synthesis engine goes well beyond traditional sampling thanks to a brand new analog modeled filter section created with the utmost expertise from IK, the pioneer in virtual circuit modeling. This is coupled with exclusive DRIFT technology to accurately reproduce the behavior of oscillators from real hardware synths. All of this combined with an effects section that is unrivaled in the world of virtual instruments along with advanced features like 4-part layers, splits and arpeggiators make Syntronik the ultimate source of inspiration with the widest palette of synthesizer sounds ranging from exact reproductions of the originals to sounds never heard before that will stand out from the crowd in productions covering any genre and style.",

The three filters are linked together so that when you change the center frequency or the bandwidth, the three filter parameters are changed accordingly: you can change the entire equalizer characteristics with one single mouse click making any equalization task very easy and intuitive.",

    "description": "Vocal Reverb works seamlessly with your vocals. Vocal Reverb has that perfect ambiance, tone and harmonics to match your vocals whether you have a real deep voice to a really high voice. Vocal Reverb doesn't have any after tone (or tail) either. So you can program Vocal Reverb to sound just like your voice while Vocal Reverb adds just that right amount of ambiance, tone and harmonics to your vocals. Vocal Reverb if programmed correctly doesn't take away from how your voice actually sounds. Having Vocal Reverb on your vocals works seamlessly and perfect when played with your beats or songs. You can add just a little saturation or a medium amount of saturation depending on how you want your vocal tracks to sound but Vocal Reverb is not set to add to much saturation. With Vocal Reverb you should start by setting the vocal saturation which adds saturation to your vocals and cleans up unwanted artifacts and makes your vocals sound more clear and smooth. This is done before the reverb kicks in. Next you should turn the reverb up just about to the point where you can just hear the reverb saturation. Then use the reverb frequency selector and go through the selections till you get one that matches your voice. Then next I would play around with the frequency range and adjust it to match your voice. Start with setting the low end to not be deeper than what your voice gets. Then set the high end to where it makes the frequency range match your voice perfect. Then go back to the reverb and turn it up and down to adjust how much reverb saturation you want to have. To help out you can use the reverb saturation selector to add more or less reverb saturation. And finally adjust the width knob to add more fullness to your vocals. After you are done adjusting everything you will realize that your vocals are now more full and you will be able to hear more emotion and heart in your vocals. Then adjust the three band EQ till it soundz just like your voice.",

Rather than control reverb and echo with the conventional knob or slider-driven, single-dimensional delay parameters and the like, reverberant effects would be created by actually creating a virtual room and laying out sources and receivers in the three dimensions - a more intuitive approach.

The Xylo Wood consist of 3 different layers that we can dial in and blend each layer with one another to create a sick wooden xylophone sound. Xylo Wood also has some essential effects such as reverb, envelopes such as attack, decay sustain, and release. The Xylo Wood is a no brainer, get your copy today.",
